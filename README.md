Crop Yield Prediction Project
Overview:
This project aims to predict the crop yield per region using Machine Learning (ML) techniques. By leveraging historical data on various factors such as weather conditions, soil quality, agricultural practices, and crop types, we develop predictive models to estimate crop yields for different regions. The ultimate goal is to provide valuable insights to farmers, agricultural policymakers, and stakeholders to optimize crop production and ensure food security.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project contains:

Historical records of crop yields per region.
Weather data including temperature, precipitation.
Crop-specific information like type of crop.
Project Structure:
The project is structured as follows:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, feature engineering, and data transformation.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the relationships between different features, identifying patterns, and gaining insights into the dataset.

Model Development: Building machine learning models to predict crop yields based on the input features. Various algorithms such as Linear Regression,are explored and evaluated for their performance.

Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), etc. Cross-validation techniques are employed to ensure robustness and generalization of the models.

Deployment: Deploying the trained model(s) into production-ready systems or platforms for real-time predictions. Integration with APIs or web interfaces may be considered for accessibility.

Requirements:
The project requires the following dependencies:

Python 
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib,
